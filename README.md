# C++ Chess Engine

This project is a chess engine built from scratch in C++ with a CPU opponent. The engine is designed to handle chess game logic, evaluate positions, and play against a human player.

## Overview

The chess engine implements standard chess rules and algorithms to play against a human player. The CPU opponent uses basic evaluation techniques and search algorithms to make decisions.

## Features

- Full implementation of chess rules and moves.
- Basic CPU opponent with move evaluation and search algorithms.
- Command-line interface for playing games and testing the engine.
